    "updates models and schema** 2. **Developer updates only Flask app code**\n",
    "3. **Developer installs new dependencies** 4. **Developer modifies local\n",
    "database contents (adds/deletes users, etc.)** 5. **Testing front-end\n",
    "code on Heroku**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each scenario involves development locally on the `development` branch\n",
    "and deployment to Heroku via the `stable-versions` branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Developer Updates Models and Schema**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you modify the database schema (e.g., add new fields, models, or\n",
    "relationships):\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Modify Models Locally**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Update your models in the Flask app to reflect the new schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: Create and Apply Migration Locally**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Generate and apply Alembic migration:\n",
    "    `bash  alembic revision --autogenerate -m \"Update schema\"  alembic upgrade head`\n",
    "-   This updates your local PostgreSQL database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 3: Commit and Push to `development` Branch**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Commit your changes (including migration files) and push to the\n",
    "    `development` branch:\n",
    "    `bash  git add .  git commit -m \"Update models and apply migrations\"  git push origin development`\n",

    "\n",
    "-   Apply the migrations on Heroku:\n",
    "    `bash  heroku run alembic upgrade head --app ws-companion`\n",

    "#### **Step 6: Sync Local Database to Heroku (Optional)**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If you want to ensure that your local data matches Heroku, you can\n",
    "    run the database sync with `truncate`: `bash  pgsync`\n",

    "\n",
    "### **2. Developer Updates Only Flask App Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you modify the Flask app code (but not the database schema):\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Make Code Changes Locally**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Make the necessary updates to your Flask app (e.g., route changes,\n",

    "\n",
    "When new dependencies (e.g., Flask extensions, Python libraries) are\n",

    "-   Install the new dependencies using `pip`:\n",
    "    `bash  pip install <new_dependency>`\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "-   Update the `requirements.txt` file with the new dependencies:\n",

    "\n",
    "-   Sync the local database to Heroku, ensuring the changes are\n",
    "    reflected: `bash  pgsync`\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Make Front-End Changes Locally**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Update the front-end code (HTML, CSS, JS) and test locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: Commit and Push to `development` Branch**\n",

    "\n",
    "This guide walks you through syncing your databases between **local and\n",
    "Heroku** environments, as well as setting up an automated backup system\n",

    "### **Part 1: Setting Up Database Syncing with `pgsync`**\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll use `pgsync` to sync your local PostgreSQL database with the\n",
    "Heroku database in both directions: **local to Heroku** and **Heroku to\n",

    "#### 1.1 What is a Makefile?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Makefile** is a configuration file used to automate tasks by\n",

    "\n",
    "We’ll use the Makefile to define tasks for syncing your database **from\n",
    "local to Heroku** and **from Heroku to local**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 Create the `.pgsync.yml` Configuration Files\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll need two configuration files for syncing databases in both\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  **Create `.pgsync-local-to-remote.yml`:**\n",

    "a `make` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Create the Makefile\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  In your project root directory, create a `Makefile`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    touch Makefile\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    nano Makefile\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Add the following content to the file:\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  Save and close the Makefile.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Run the Sync Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the sync commands, you can run: - Sync **local to Heroku**:\n",

    "\n",
    "After ensuring your database is synced, it’s crucial to safeguard your\n",
    "**content tables** by creating regular backups stored in a third-party\n",

    "### **Step 3: Create a Shell Script for Content Table Backup**\n",
    "\n",
    "This shell script will back up specific content-related tables from your\n",
    "PostgreSQL database and store the backup in **iCloud Drive**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Create the Shell Script\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  In your project directory, create the backup script:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    touch backup_to_icloud.sh\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Open the file in a text editor:\n",

    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    nano backup_to_icloud.sh\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Add the following content:\n",

    "### **Step 4: Add Backup Command to the Makefile**\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll add a rule in the Makefile to manually trigger content backups\n",

    "#### 4.1 Update the Makefile\n",

    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    nano Makefile\n",
