## Title: SQLite Crash Course for Terminal Usage

### Description:
SQLite is a lightweight, file-based database engine that is easy to set up and use, especially for development and small-scale applications. It is extensively used due to its simplicity and zero-configuration setup. This brief crash course provides essential commands for using SQLite in the terminal, including connecting to a database, managing tables, and viewing data. The goal is to offer a quick reference for basic SQLite tasks with a focus on practical command usage.

### Command Format in SQLite

1. **Ease of Use**:  
   SQLite is highly intuitive with commands that are simple and easy to execute, making it a great tool for quick database operations.
   
2. **Command Structure**:  
   SQLite commands follow standard SQL syntax with commands typically starting with keywords like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, etc. Commands should be typed in all caps for readability, though SQLite is case-insensitive.
   
3. **Variables and Strings**:  
   - Variables and column names are generally used without quotes unless they contain special characters.
   - Strings and date literals should be enclosed in single quotes (`' '`). For example: `'alicejohnson'` or `'2024-07-29 14:00:00'`.
   
4. **Ending Commands**:  
   - Each command must end with a semicolon (`;`). This signals the end of the statement and allows SQLite to execute the command.

5. **Important Syntax Notes**:
   - Commands are executed line-by-line, and missing a semicolon will prompt SQLite to expect continuation, causing errors if not handled correctly.
   - Comments can be added using `--` for single-line comments or `/* ... */` for multi-line comments.

### Action Table

| **Action**                     | **Command**                                                        | **Output**                                           | **Purpose**                                         |

| **List All Tables**            | `.tables`                                                          | `users  orders  products`                            | Lists all tables in the connected database          |
| **View Table Schema**          | `.schema users`                                                    | Shows SQL creation statement for `users` table       | Displays the structure of the `users` table         |
| **Detailed Table Info**        | `PRAGMA table_info(users);`                                        | Shows detailed column info (`cid`, `name`, etc.)     | Provides detailed column information                |
| **View All Records**           | `SELECT * FROM users;`                                             | Lists all records in the `users` table               | Views all rows in the `users` table                 |
| **Insert New Record**          | `INSERT INTO users (username, email, last_updated) VALUES ('alicejohnson', 'alice.johnson@example.com', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);` | Inserts new row                                     | Adds a new user with the current timestamp          |
| **Insert Record with Custom Date** | `INSERT INTO users (username, email, last_updated) VALUES ('bobsmith', 'bob.smith@example.com', '2024-07-29 14:00:00');` | Inserts new row                                     | Adds a new user with a specified timestamp          |
| **Update Existing Record**     | `UPDATE users SET last_updated = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE username = 'alicejohnson';` | Updates specific row                                | Updates the `last_updated` field for a specific user|
| **Delete a Record**            | `DELETE FROM users WHERE username = 'alicejohnson';`               | Deletes a specific row                               | Removes a user from the `users` table               |
| **Exit SQLite**                | `.exit`                                                            | Exits SQLite prompt                                  | Closes the SQLite session                           |
